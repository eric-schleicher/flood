CUSTOM NODES

if you close a workspace and it's still in use 
	- add it to hidden workspaces
	- otherwise completely remove it

don't show previews in custom node workspaces

polygon node
configure node-webkit endpoint URL

dropping in a previously created, nested custom node causes placed node to return null value
enter custom node by double clicking on the node instance
paste should be offset to workspace center

deletion is too slow

UI

drop down to export to STL, or OBJ


WORKSPACES MENU

formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
should remember the old 3d orientation


FEATURE

example workspaces
fork a workspace
share workspaces
describe workspace
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood
run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker


THOUGHTS

verb: 
	breps
	use distributed computation
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
