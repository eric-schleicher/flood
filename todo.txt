CURRENT

previews are screwed up when you get a list of solids
more delay for tooltip on output port
node port heights are messed up when zoomed
save zoom when changed


POLISH

share workspaces
fork a workspace
OBJ export
example workspaces
initial user walkthrough of interface
formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
desktop zoom is too slow
login/signup sucks should work with oauth - initially
too many workspaces?  you need to hide the excess one
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
don't keep workspaces that haven't been saved at least once
should remember the old 3d orientation
workspaces menu should update when you reopen it
icons, tooltips for undo, redo, etc.

optimize css:
	eliminate inline css 
	get rid of excess bootstrap css, jquery.ui css

FEATURE

before release

easily add a new library of nodes
custom nodes
archive workspaces
describe workspace
proxy server for doing remote http
curves - whats the minimum requirement - line - polyline?
transforms?
canvas marquee selection
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood

run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker

promise-based execution

verb: 
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
