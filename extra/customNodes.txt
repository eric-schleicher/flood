Confirm we can compile a set of nodes to a lambda, add a unit test for this

WorkspaceSchema

	// for non-functions
	IsCustomNode
	FunctionId

	// for functions 
	WorkspaceDependencies


flood_runner 

	FLOOD.NodeTypes.FloodFunction[] Functions


Before opening a workspace:

	Get reference to all dependents (possibly using local copy from other home workspace)
	Rebuild dependents making them available in Search, define associated node


	Then the dependency changes - the workspace will need to send the update to the runner for the dependents
	You send me an update to custom node - I will recompile that custom node and update the environment
	The runner can hold onto the functions


FLOOD.NodeTypes.FloodFunction

	Unique ID
	Its inputs and outputs are modified similar to a normal node


WorkspaceTabView

	Extend "New" button to pick Project or Node
	Extend single TabView UI to distinguish from normal Tab


SearchElements

	Input, Output - with specified name


Runner Requirements

	Compile a workspace to a lambda
	Define the workspace in the environment of the scheme interpreter
