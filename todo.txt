CUSTOM NODES


preview scroll-x blocks view

BUG

	create custom node
	create workspace
	add nodes to custom node
	add custom node to workspace
	refresh
	custom node result is null
	custom node is not compiled

cleanup dependencies has flawed logic
should be able to set the names of inputs/outputs
dropping in a previously created, nested custom node causes placed node to return null value
insure unnecessary deps are removed on startup
enter custom node by double clicking on the node instance


paste should be offset to workspace center

UI

drop down to create new project or custom node
drop down to export to STL, or OBJ


WORKSPACES MENU

tools to refresh workspaces menu
node port locations need fixing
formula node input should change width based on how much user inputs, allow multiple lines
formula node does not allow "quotes"
disable node lacing
icons for nodes
should remember the old 3d orientation

icons for undo/redo/copy/paste

optimize css:
	eliminate inline css
	get rid of excess bootstrap css, jquery.ui css

FEATURE

initial user walkthrough of interface - just modify help
example workspaces
fork a workspace
share workspaces
describe workspace
arbitrary javascript node - better than formula
NURBS in flood
run execution in ui thread, make calls to ui thread from worker


THOUGHTS

verb: 
	breps
	use distributed computation
	use a neural network to train system for local or remote exec
flood: 
	promise-based execution would allow multiple execution paths to proceed in parallel if nodes are dispatched async - this is a VERY good idea
